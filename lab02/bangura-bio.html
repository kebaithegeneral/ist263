<h2>International Political Economist/Part-time Superhero</h2>
	<p>Alhassan Bangura is a current <strong></strong>Political Science and Policy Studies dual major, with a minor in <strong> Information Management and Technologies</strong>. He is interested in International relations, understanding the real contributors or <strong>“players”</strong> of the world, and deciphering how they all engage with each other whilst keeping the average human being totally lost. Al won two superbowls in highschool, and has yet to achieve any reputable skills at this stage in his career. Outside of work, he likes to listen to music, hangout with his Brothers on campus and just sleep. Growing up, he watched Spongebob, and since then that has never changed. Now he spends his short lived adult life defending said show as the best cartoon of all time. A newbie to the tech world, he is looking to broaden his skillset, and add web design and development to his rapport!</p>
